This project centers around basic DOM manipulation using panel images as an example. There are a set of images display-flex in a row with the first card having an additional 'active' class property. OnClick, any 'active' class will be removed and the object that was clicked will have the 'active' class added via addEventListener. Upon change, the active class will reduce in size and opacity to place a visual focus on the new active card.
